You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
않이 다 좋은데 왜 C 코드 하이라이팅 안돼요 ㅠㅠ 
아니 이번엔 하이라이팅이 날아갔어 씨발? 


```C 
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
	printf("hi");
	return 0;
}
// hey
/*dear */
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
