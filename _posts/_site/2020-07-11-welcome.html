<p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve --watch</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code class="highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
않이 다 좋은데 왜 C 코드 하이라이팅 안돼요 ㅠㅠ</p>

<pre><code class="language-C">
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){
	printf("hi");
	return 0;
}
// hey
/*dear */
#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
</code></pre>
